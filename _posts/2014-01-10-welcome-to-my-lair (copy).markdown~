This post is not interesting.

This is the necessary but boring first post introducing the blog. Blah blah blah. I am honoured etcetera etcetera.

This blog is about my projects, mainly HTML5 games. You can checkout [fluzzies][fluzzies], that is the most interesting thing you can find out over here. Arts by [Dan][Dan].

Blah blah, see you soon in more interesting posts.

(wkaeleuve is how you would read KLV in spanish with a w in front, but you don't read it, because it's mute)

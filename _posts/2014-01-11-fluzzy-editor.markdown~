To test the fluzzy's hairs I made this little buggy [tool][fluzzies]. You can customize your own fluzzy with the hairs you want. I actually managed to do some curious stuff, but I lost the files and I don't feel like fighting with this buggy piece of sh\*\*t that I put together in two days. But, ey, I thought that the Internet deserved to see any buggy piece of sh\*\*t that anyone puts together in two days, so I posted it here so I will never ever be lost.
